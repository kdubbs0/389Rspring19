This was done via the [ELMS assignment](). (we'll post an announcement when this is ready!)

### Part 2 (75 pts)

With the given information, it is clear that the lives of our company’s customers are at stake with this decision. If our product was to be made public, its vulnerabilities would not only cost us the products that we make but also the public’s trust and our reputation.

Between my boss, a consumer watchdog, and the public, I would tell those three in their respective order, each after the previous fails. It would be ideal if the problem could be addressed from the root; telling my boss would pass on the message to those with more and more power and (might) eventually reach those who have the power to make the decision that will address the problem. Hopefully they conclude that losing money by pushing back the ECU’s release date is better than the potential lawsuits that will come if our customers are harmed by our product.

Telling my boss would be a definite minimum. On the chance that either the information does not reach the top or a decision to continue with the publication of the product, the option of telling consumer watchdogs or the public still lies on the table. Whether to do so or not would depend on other factors as well such as overall risk, extent of danger, etc. Though this may be against company policies, the ethically correct thing to do would be to at least inform the customers of the risks of using the product. I would not try to involve outside parties into company affairs if it can be helped.

If I do nothing, I would be equally as responsible for any harm that results as much as my co-workers and those in charge of me. I would have had the option to inform anyone who did not already know about the situation. If a customer is harmed due to the product, I could have prevented it if I at least told my boss about it.
