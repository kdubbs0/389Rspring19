$1337 v expensive

### Part 2 (60 Pts)
- difficult for me bc idk javascript :'(
- "alert();" is useful
- basically find wherever can run that and put it in there
	1. insert script block inside query
	2. insert code into text box that produces an error, alert() on error
	3. produce an error in the url, alert() on error
	4. do some weird stuff from looking at the src code and a lot of guessing
	5. alert() after the "next=" in the url
	6. whatever is after the # in the url is being loaded; it cannot load anything with "http" but this means it must be lowercase, so you can do "HTTP" instead
