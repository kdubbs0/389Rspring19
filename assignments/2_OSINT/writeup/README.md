3. personal info:
v0idcache is the username of the Twitter user Elizabeth Moffet. This account was found using the Twitter Tool on IntelTechniques. The tool was chosen by chance and the username "v0idcache" was inputted. Moffet lives in Waterland, Netherlands. This was found using who.is by entering the URL 1337bank.money found on Moffet's Twitter page. In addition to her Twitter page, her Reddit account @v0idcache was found as well.

Both the Twitter and Reddit accounts were confirmed using SocialSearcher. No other social media accounts were found. This is confirmed by both NameVine and UserSherlock.
fl1nch and Dev0id_cache are two contacts found connected to v0idcache. fl1nch was found by searching "v0idcache" on pastebin.com, and a conversation between the two came up. In this conversation, a file called AB4300.txt was mentioned. Dev0id_cache was found using SocialSearcher; it appears as if Dev0id_cache is male, for he tried to shoot his shot on Twitter but was, unfortunately, ghosted by Moffet (but hey it's 2019). No other contacts were found.
Some emails associated with v0idcache are v0idcache@protonmail.com, v0idcache@gmail.com, v0idcache@hotmail.com, v0idcache@aol.com, and v0idcache@yahoo.com. The ProtonMail account was found on her website. The other four emails were found using PeekYou and Spokeo.
